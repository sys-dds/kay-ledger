# Merchant Events Api

Merchant events APIs expose finance event envelopes, delivery state, retries, and terminal outcomes.

## Design questions

- Is the action idempotent?
- Does it affect ledger truth?
- Does it require approval?
- Can it affect a closed period?
- Does it emit an event?
- Does it need evidence?
